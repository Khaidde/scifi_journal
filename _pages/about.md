Tech Insight aims to foster a young community of science fiction fans with a focus on relating fiction to modern issues. The magazine covers a wide range of genres with topics ranging from artificial intelligence and alien life to technology and cinema. Ever since its establishment in 2021, Tech Insight's greatest priority has been to provide high quality content for science fiction fans while also promoting less known works by talented young writers.

Tech Insight was originally founded in 2021 by a group of students at Georgia Institute of Technology. The magazine is currently run by the founding members and has no current plans to expand.
