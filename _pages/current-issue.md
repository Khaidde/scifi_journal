### Artificial Intelligence Essay

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the ability for machines to mimic the perception, problem-solving, critical thinking, and learning often displayed by the human mind. In simpler terms, it’s giving electronic machines the ability to think like the smartest organic living things on the planet. AI is often considered a futuristic concept, shrouded in convoluting mystery, complex science, and sometimes subtle fear. While nowhere yet near its full capacity, many people often wonder about AI’s potential scope. Those speculations range from the outright calamitous to the bleakly hopeful. What both those sides of the argument agree on, however, is that AI’s is growing at a surprising rate, and that its potential right now seems to be almost limitless...

I’m now a freshman in college, and I’d say my view of the world has changed a little since then so it might be interesting to go back and analyze AoU with my increased maturity.

### Where AI is Today

Artificial Intelligence, or AI, has propelled technological innovations to a whole new level. AI can be described as a computer system that can perform tasks that normally require human intelligence.

One incredible recent development that is having a major effect on everyone’s lives right now is how AI helped in the creation of the COVID-19 vaccine. Vaccines usually take years and even decades to develop. This is because of the vast amount of data researchers must go through in this process. However, new machine learning was able to sort through the tens of thousands of the virus’s subcomponents to predict the ones that are most likely to produce an immune response...
