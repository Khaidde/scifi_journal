### Analysis of Artificial Intelligence: Can AI be Controlled?

In simpler terms, the idea behind AI is giving electronic machines the ability to think like the smartest organic living things on the planet. AI is often considered a futuristic concept, shrouded in convoluting mystery, complex science, and sometimes subtle fear. While nowhere yet near its full capacity, many people often wonder about AI’s potential. Those speculations have a wide scope, with arguments ranging from the outright calamitous to the bleakly hopeful.

In 1950, Alan Turing asked the question that would lead to the creation of AI in his paper “Computing Machinery and Intelligence." His question of “Can machines think?” has had people trying to answer it in the affirmative ever since. Advances in AI have created a shift in nearly every part of the technology industry...
