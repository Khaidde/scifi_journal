Let’s take a trip down memory lane to May 2015. Everyone was eagerly waiting for summer break, but, for me, I was more excited for the next Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) movie: _Avengers: Age of Ultron_. After the successful pilot in the Avengers series (with a 91% on Rotten Tomatoes), and the hype from the other Marvel films produced after The Avengers (save Iron Man 3—most of us forget that exists), it was safe to say this was the most highly anticipated movie of the summer.

Since six years have now passed, I want to revisit this film. I was in 7th grade when Age of Ultron (AoU) came out. Now as a freshman in college, I would say my view of the world has changed, so it might be interesting to go back and analyze AoU with my increased maturity.

Joss Whedon did both the screenwriting and directing of AoU. Whedon fulfilled the same positions in the making of the first Avengers film. Kevin Fiege produced the movie, along with all of the MCU movies since Iron Man. Both of these men have had experience working with the universe, which keeps the movies cohesive with one another. AoU was one of the movies released in the later part of what we like to call “Phase II” in the MCU, and both Whedon and Feige did a wonderful job of tying in the developments within the previous movies of Phase I and II. Looking back after just having completed Phase III, it’s really incredible how well the events in each film click together.

Age of Ultron is just that—the age of Ultron. Ultron is an AI created by Tony Stark with the intention of it being a peacekeeping force on planet Earth and somewhat of a defense mechanism against aliens. However, Ultron is, by our standards, faulty and believes that the only way to guarantee world peace is through world extinction. Through this plot, we are introduced to Vision and Scarlet Witch, who both appear in following Marvel films. I first thought the plot of AoU was very random in comparison to what had happened in the previous movies of Phase II. However, AoU is very important in the MCU because it sets up the basis for the plans of the major villain Thanos with the introduction of the Infinity Stones,sets the scene for Thor: Ragnarok with the disappearance of Dr. Banner, and establishes the tensions felt between Iron Man and Captain America that resurface in Captain America: Civil War.

Overall, I truly enjoyed this movie, probably more so than I did the first Avengers, which, in all fairness, might have been because I had no clue what the Avengers were when my dad took me and my brother to see it in 2012. That being said, there are many things I think AoU does amazingly well on. First of all, and arguably most importantly, the plot is believable but not so incredibly easy to follow that you “see the future.” Though the sci-fi elements can be a stretch sometimes, it is entirely possible that we would try and create a new piece of technology to protect humanity. The Avengers and the MCU had a small taste of what alien life can be like before they turned to AI. In our world, we have no insight on alien life, which I think makes us even more susceptible to needing to create something to protect ourselves.

It’s also noteworthy that there is an evident argument over how much we should rely on AI and technology in general. Stark remarks that he wants the world to be protected by a “suit of armor,” in which Dr. Banner replies, “Sounds like a cold war, Tony.” Marvel does an incredible job at displaying the real world dilemma. On one hand, AI can blow up in our face by gaining too much free will while on the other hand, a lack of AI can severely stilt our technological progress. Also, I truly believe that if we did ever get our hands on alien technology, we would experiment with it just like Stark and Banner did. We are simply too curious for new things.

Taking a step back, I want to highlight the exchange between Vision and Ultron near the end of the movie. It is the brilliant exchange between two AI creations which influence Tony Stark and his true will- protection of humanity. However, we, as the audience, can see the two situations emerge through Vision and Ultron. Vision is the ultimate end result: he’s powerful and he wants the best for humanity. But isn’t Ultron the same? The difference is that Vision decides to help preserve humanity in the hopes that they can achieve world peace, while Ultron came to the ultimate conclusion that peace is unachievable. It’s very bold of Marvel as such an influential franchise to comment on a subject that’s so controversial, but since they do it through the eyes of scientists and the AI themselves, it makes it easier to understand the two opinions.

Through these ideas, I wouldn’t be surprised if you thought AoU was a very technical and scientific movie. That’s not the case, because if there’s one thing Marvel does extremely well, it’s their comedic timing. Between all of the science mumbo-jumbo that’s going on, there’s always a witty quip or snort-worthy joke. It makes a serious issue like the debate over AI more casual and comfortable to discuss or listen to. Honestly, Marvel could release a movie entirely based on one session of the United States House of Representatives and make billions just on their inclusivity of humor.

One last thing that is hard to fully explain through words: The cinematography of this movie is amazing. You’ll have to watch it to believe it.

There are some things I have to admit aren’t great about AoU. First of all, some things are a little far-fetched. How on Earth does a scepter with a gem called the Mind Stone grant someone super speed? And how far can Wanda’s powers go if she can make things move with her mind AND control people’s minds? AoU is science fiction, but at some points you have to stop and wonder. Secondly, the amount of coincidences in this movie that occur is slightly ridiculous. Of course the second AI creation is successful. Of course there happens to be a Doctor who has managed to create a technology to regenerate tissue of its own accord. Thank goodness Thor had that vision of the Infinity Stones and decided to blast the cradle with lightning. Of course there is a guy who knows how to smuggle vibranium out of Wakanda, an extremely well hidden high-tech country who is not on the UN’s radar. You get the picture.

This movie is very long. It’s roughly two and a half hours long. And there’s a lot of things that are easily missed within your first viewing. I’d say I’ve seen this movie at least 10 times, and I still catch things I missed in the other several times I’ve watched it. It wasn’t until about my third or fourth time that I actually realized what they were doing in Johannesburg. Make sure to make your popcorn, get your drinks, and go to the bathroom before you settle down to watch it.

Overall, I think _Avengers: Age of Ultron_ is definitely worth your time. Whether you’re an avid Marvel fan who is caught up with every last issue of the comics, or someone who is being dragged to see a superhero movie you really couldn’t care less about, I believe you’ll enjoy this movie. It has a good balance of everything that makes it a good movie. You’ll probably have to suspend your logic for the science fiction, but it’s not overbearing. And just make sure you have enough time. But, all in all, hopefully you will find you enjoyed this movie, and you start to wonder what ever happened to Banner, if Wanda and Vision show up again, and if Captain America and Iron Man ever do agree on anything. I guess you’ll just have to watch the other MCU movies to find out.
