Artificial intelligence, or AI, has propelled technological innovations to a whole new level. AI can be described as a branch of technology that covers a wide range of different computer systems which can perform tasks that normally require human intelligence. In 1950, Alan Turing asked the question that would lead to the creation of AI in his paper “Computing Machinery and Intelligence." His question of “Can machines think?” has had people trying to answer it in the affirmative ever since. Advances in AI have created a shift in nearly every part of the technology industry.

One incredible recent development that is having a major effect on everyone’s lives right now is how AI has helped in the creation of the [COVID-19 vaccine](https://spectrum.ieee.org/artificial-intelligence/medical-ai/what-ai-can-and-cant-do-in-the-race-for-a-coronavirus-vaccine). Immunization has been around for over 200 years, but it has not changed much recently, until now. Vaccines usually take years or even decades to develop. The previous vaccine turnaround time record was held by the mumps vaccine, which took four years to be publicly available. This is because of the vast amount of data researchers must go through in this process. However, thanks to new machine learning, AI was able to sort through the tens of thousands of the virus’s subcomponents to predict the ones that are most likely to produce an immune response. In March of 2020, vaccines for the coronavirus were already being tested after the outbreak began a few months prior. Now, in April of 2021, the vaccine is widespread and available in the United States for everyone over the age of 16. It is only thanks to AI that this vaccine was able to be pushed out with such a quick turnaround time.

AI can also aid in making humans’ lives easier, even in smaller or simpler ways. It is no secret that companies like Tesla have self-driving cars, but the technology behind that has greatly matured in the past year. New robotaxi services are open to the public in select cities. It is similar to taking an Uber, but the car is your driver. However, these still require a human safety driver to still be present. If this technology continues advancing at its current rate, fully automated driving will be here in the near future. Once this happens, this could totally change the trucking and delivery industry by replacing human jobs.

[Natural language processing](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/01/14/1016122/these-five-ai-developments-will-shape-2021-and-beyond/) is something often left out of the AI conversation, but in the past year it has become significantly more advanced. Computers can now interpret human language patterns with more understanding. It can also express understanding about an image through language. This is beneficial for more accurate search results and better chatbots which will be especially valuable for businesses who utilize virtual assistants.

The deepfake has been around for a couple years now, but it has recently become much more advanced. Deepfakes use a type of artificial intelligence called deep learning to create fake videos. They can generate faces of people who don’t exist, or put words in people’s mouth. This started out as a lighthearted way to make a celebrity say something funny, but its potential is concerning. People are debating whether or not this technology should be accessible to the public because of its potential to blackmail people and be used in politics.

Quantum computing has significantly risen in advancedness over the past year. It may one day replace the binary model of computing. It has the power to “supercharge AI applications” more than binary-based computers. For instance, quantum computing can go through larger datasets in a shorter time span, allowing for more accurate machine learning models. Ironically, current machine learning programs are researching quantum computing so that better AI can be programmed in the future. Imagine what this could do in real-world scenarios such as vaccine development and natural language processing.

Additionally, AI has become a game changer for how people exchange on the [stock market](https://builtin.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-trading-stock-market-tech). In a recent study, almost 45 percent of revenues in cash equities trading have been electronic trades. These robo-advisers analyze millions of data points and trade stocks at the best possible price. However, not everyone is comfortable yet with automated trading, so they use AI-powered analysis. These robo-analysts are used to project the ebb and flow of the stock market. They can do so with greater accuracy than humans because of their data sorting speed. This data can help trading firms be more efficient in calculating risk and reward. Adding AI to the equation has completely rewritten how people approach the stock market. The combination of machine learning technology and high-speed data processing power has given companies a new edge on assessing compliance risk.

Artificial intelligence rapidly changes the world around us. History always repeats itself, and, before we know it, many people’s jobs will be replaced by AI. However, people have been worried about machines taking their jobs since the industrial revolution. Just like back then, these new and scary technologies will eventually create new jobs that don’t exist today. Artificial intelligence is the next major milestone in technological development.
