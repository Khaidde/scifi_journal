Artificial Intelligence, or AI, has propelled technological innovations to a whole new level. AI can be described as a computer system that can perform tasks that normally require human intelligence.

One incredible recent development that is having a major effect on everyone’s lives right now is how AI helped in the creation of the COVID-19 vaccine. Vaccines usually take years and even decades to develop. This is because of the vast amount of data researchers must go through in this process. However, new machine learning was able to sort through the tens of thousands of the virus’s subcomponents to predict the ones that are most likely to produce an immune response.

AI can also aid in making human’s lives easier, even in smaller or simpler ways. It is no secret that companies like Tesla have self-driving cars, but the technology behind that has greatly matured in the past year. New robotaxi services are open to the public in select cities. It is like taking an Uber, but the car is your driver. However, these still require a human safety driver ro still be on board. If this technology continues advancing at its current rate, fully automated driving will be here in the near future. Once this happens, this could totally change the trucking and delivery industry by replacing the humans’ jobs.

Natural language processing is something often left out of the A. conversation, but in the past year it has become significantly more advanced. The computer can now interpret human language patterns with more understanding. It can also express understanding about an image through language. This is beneficial for more accurate search results and better chatbots. This will be very valuable for businesses who utilize virtual assistants.

Quantum computing has significantly risen in advancedness over the past year. It may one day replace the binary model of computing. It has the power to “supercharge AI applications” more than binary-based computers. For instance, quantum computing can go through larger datasets in a shorter time span, allowing for more accurate machine learning models. Ironically. current machine learning programs are researching quantum computing so that better AI can be programmed in the future. Imagine what this could do in real-world scenarios such as vaccine development and natural language processing.

Artificial Intelligence is rapidly changing the world around us. Before we know it, many people’s jobs will be replaced by AI, but just like when people freaked out about this during the industrial revolution, new jobs will be created because of it.
